# CosmicShield: Asteroid Defense Simulator

https://koriym.github.io/html-play/solar-system-simulator.html

This project is an interactive 3D visualization designed to demonstrate how massive celestial bodies like Jupiter and the Sun act as natural shields, protecting Earth from potential asteroid impacts. By simulating asteroid trajectories and gravitational influences, it offers an engaging way to understand cosmic defense mechanisms.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this simulator is to educate users about:

1. The protective role of massive planets in our solar system
2. How gravitational forces influence asteroid trajectories
3. The concept of natural "Cosmic Shields" in planetary defense

While the visualization includes a simplified representation of the solar system, it's important to note that this is not intended to be an accurate solar system simulator. The solar system elements serve as a context for demonstrating the CosmicShield concept in asteroid defense.

## Key Features

- Visualization of how Jupiter and other massive bodies deflect asteroids
- Real-time asteroid generation and trajectory calculation
- Collision detection to show successful "shielding" events
- Dynamic camera movement to provide various perspectives of the shielding effect
- User interface displaying statistics on asteroid deflections and Earth impacts

## Visualization Elements

- Simplified representations of the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, and other planets
- Asteroid trajectories shown as red trails
- 3D grid to provide spatial context
- Gravitational influence visualized through asteroid path alterations

## Educational Value

This CosmicShield visualization serves as an educational tool to demonstrate:

1. The importance of Jupiter and other massive bodies in Earth's cosmic defense system
2. Basic principles of gravitational influence on small bodies in space
3. The concept of "planetary protection" in our solar system

Users can observe in real-time how the gravitational pull of Jupiter and the Sun affects asteroid trajectories, potentially deflecting them away from Earth, thus illustrating their role as "cosmic shields" for our planet.

## Technical Implementation

- Built using Three.js for 3D rendering
- Utilizes dat.GUI for user-adjustable parameters
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Efficient asteroid management system to handle multiple objects

## Project Development

The CosmicShield Visualization was developed through a collaborative effort:

- **Direction and Concept**: Akihito Koriyama
- **Coding and Implementation**: AI Assistant (Claude)

The entire coding process, including the HTML, JavaScript, and Three.js implementation, was carried out by the AI assistant under the direction of Akihito Koriyama. This project showcases the potential of AI-assisted development in creating educational scientific visualizations.
